XOpenME is a simplified OpenME plugin without extenral dependencies
to be linked with various apps and tools to dump system state 
in json format to CK


FGG note:
 unlike Linux, on Windows creation of static and dynamic libs is slightly
 different. In both cases .lib is created and both static (/MT) and dynamic
 flags can be used (/MT). It creates a complexity.

 To simplify that, on Windows on compile only static lib but with /MD, i.e.
 itself it does not include sublibs ...

 Then by default ck compile program also uses dynamic compilation, will link
 this lib statically, but will resolve all the other dependencies dynamically too ...
