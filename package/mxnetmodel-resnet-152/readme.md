We first download a pre-trained ResNet 152 layer that is trained
on the full ImageNet dataset with over 10 million images and 10
thousand classes. A pre-trained model contains two parts, a json
file containing the model definition and a binary file
containing the parameters. In addition, there may be a text file
for the labels.
